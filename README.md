Mycol

A lightweight, human-in-the-loop microscopy image analysis app.

Mycol is a Streamlit-based application that makes machine-learning–assisted microscopy analysis accessible to non-specialists. It enables fast annotation, automated segmentation and classification, model fine-tuning, and quantitative phenotyping—all on a standard laptop and without coding.
