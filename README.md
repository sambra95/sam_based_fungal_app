# **Mycol**  
*A lightweight, human-in-the-loop microscopy image analysis app.*

Mycol is a Streamlit-based application that makes machine-learning-assisted microscopy analysis accessible to non-specialists. It enables fast annotation, automated segmentation and classification, model fine-tuning, and quantitative phenotyping, all on a standard laptop and without coding.

## **Features**

### **Annotation & QC**
- Upload images and optional masks  
- Manual mask drawing and editing  
- SAM2-guided segmentation  
- Automated Cellpose segmentation (single or batch mode)  
- Interactive classification (manual or DenseNet-based)

### **Model Fine-Tuning**
- Train Cellpose (segmentation) and DenseNet (classification) models directly in the app  
- Default training settings for general use  
- Diagnostic outputs:  
  - Loss curves  
  - IoU scores  
  - True vs. predicted counts  
  - Accuracy, precision, F1, confusion matrix  
- Download trained models and training summaries  

### **Cell Metrics & Phenotyping**
- Automatic computation of cell descriptors (size, shape, elongation, compactness, etc.)  
- Visual comparison of phenotypic classes  
- Export plots and tabulated descriptors  
- Built-in explanations for descriptor interpretation  

### **Lightweight & Accessible**
- Runs locally on standard hardware  
- Minimal dependencies  
- Designed for small-scale workflows

## **Installation**

> [!WARNING]
> `uv` is the recommended package manager for this project. It is a drop-in replacement for `pip` and `conda`.
> to install `uv`, run `pip install uv` or follow the [instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
> use `uv sync` to automatically create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
> use `uv run` to execute python inside the virtual environment e.g. `uv run streamlit run app.py`, or activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` on unix or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on windows.


```bash
uv sync
```

## **Run the App locally**

```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

---

## **Example Use Cases**
- Rapid cell counting  
- Creating curated datasets of annotated images
- Automating image annotation (with human QC)  
- Morphology-based phenotypic comparison
