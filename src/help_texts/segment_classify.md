### 2. Segment and classify your cells

This page is where you can **explore, edit, and analyze your images** using Mycol’s AI and interactive tools.

Here you can:

- **View your uploaded images** overlaid with their associated **cell masks**.  
- **Generate new masks** automatically using AI models such as **Cellpose** or **SAM2**.  
- **Manually edit or correct masks** with interactive tools — add, remove, or adjust individual cells as needed.  
- **Classify cells** using:  
  - an uploaded **DenseNet model** for automated classification, or  
  - **manual labeling** by clicking directly on cells in the image.  

Once your masks and classifications are ready, you can:

- **Download your dataset** for use in your own analysis pipelines, or  
- **Train new machine learning models** within Mycol to automate future segmentation and classification tasks.

Use this page to refine your data and build smarter, faster workflows for your cell analysis.
