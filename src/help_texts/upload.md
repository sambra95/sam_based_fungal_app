### 1. Upload Your data

Welcome to the **Upload page** — this is where your analysis begins.

Here you can upload the key files **Mycol** will use in later steps:

- **Images** *(required)* – the microscopy or sample images you want to analyze.  
- **Masks** *(optional)* – segmentation masks that outline cells or regions of interest.  
- **Cellpose model** *(optional)* – a trained model you can reuse for automatic cell segmentation.  
- **DenseNet model** *(optional)* – a classification model for identifying or labeling the segmented cells.

Once your files are uploaded, you’ll see a **summary table** showing:
- Which images have masks linked,  
- How many cells are highlighted in each image,  
- And any models you’ve provided for analysis or classification.

Use this page to confirm that all your data and models are correctly loaded before moving on to image analysis.
