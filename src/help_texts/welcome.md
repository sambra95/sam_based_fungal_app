### Welcome to Mycol

**Mycol** is an interactive platform for exploring, segmenting, and classifying microscopy images — powered by AI and designed to streamline your analysis workflow.

With Mycol, you can:

- **Upload microscopy images** of cells or tissues.  
- **Add or generate segmentation masks** using built-in AI tools such as **Cellpose** or **SAM2**.  
- **Classify cells** automatically with trained **DenseNet** models or manually by selecting cells in the image.  
- **Review and refine your results** interactively — correct masks, relabel cells, or adjust classifications in real time.  
- **Download your processed datasets** for external analysis, or  
- **Train new machine learning models** directly within Mycol to accelerate future analyses.

Whether you’re preparing data for quantitative cell analysis, building custom AI models, or exploring sample morphology, Mycol gives you a flexible, visual environment to make the process fast, transparent, and reproducible.
