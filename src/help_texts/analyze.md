### 4. Get to know your data

The **Cell Analysis** page allows you to explore and summarize the quantitative results of your analyses.

You can create and download plots of **cell population statistics**—such as cell area, perimeter, and other morphological or intensity-based features—grouped by **cell class**.

Select which **classes** and **characteristics** to include, and Mycol will generate clear, publication-quality plots that help you:

- Compare how cell size, shape, or intensity differ between classes or conditions  
- Identify trends in cell populations across multiple images or experiments  
- Quantify variability and relationships among measured features  

In addition to plots, the downloadable results include:

- Tables summarizing the **number of cells per class** in each image  
- **Descriptive statistics** (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for all selected features  
- The generated plots in a ready-to-use format for reports or publications  

Use this page to transform your image-level analyses into meaningful biological insights about cell populations, morphology, and class-specific behaviors.
